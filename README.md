# GCMApp: Github Community Manager's App for Network Analysis
In a recent big data training, i have an opportunity to challenge a sample data of github with a team.
It was very short and the job was not completely done.
That is why I rethink the work and decide a new challenge: Investigate github archive to have a kind of application for the community.
I will use the datas stored on BigQuery (Google Clood Platform) https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/github.
For the analyse i use NEO4J GRAPH and ALGORYTHMS.

These topics here are as follows:

1-Cleaning and wrangling datas with bigquery

2-Import datas in Neo4j GraphDatabase

3-Recommendation engine with cypher

4-Network Analysis with graph algorithms
